	<h2>
	<p> I think that I shall never see,
	A poem lovely as a tree. </p>
	<br>
	<p> A tree whose hungry mouth is prest,
	Against the earths's sweet flowing breast; </p>
	<br>
	<p> A tree that looks at God all day,
	And lifts her leafy arms to pray;</p>
	<br>
	<p> A tree that may in summer wear a
	nest of robins in her hair;</p>
	<br>
	<p> Upon Whose bosom snow has lain;
	Who intimately lives with rain.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Poems are made by fools like me,
	but only God can make a tree.</p>
	<br>
