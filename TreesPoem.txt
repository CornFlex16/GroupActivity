    <p> I think that I shall never see <br>
        A poem lovely as a tree. <br>
        <br>
        A tree whose hungry mouth is prest <br>
        Against the earth's sweet flowing breast; <br>
         <br>
        A tree that looks at God all day, <br>
        And lifts her leafy arms to pray; <br>
        <br>
        A tree that may in summer wear <br>
        A nest of robins in her hair; <br>
        <br>
        Upon whose bosom snow has lain; <br>
        Who intimately lives with rain. <br>
         <br>
        Poems are made by fools like me, <br>
        But only God can make a tree. <br>
